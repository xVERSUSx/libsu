/**
 * An {@link java.io.InputStream} that read files by opening a new root process.
 * <p>
 * The difference between this class and {@link SuFileInputStream} is that this class does not
 * use a shell to do the I/O operations; instead it directly creates a new process to read the file.
 * In most cases, {@link SuFileInputStream} is sufficient; however if you expect a very high I/O
 * throughput (e.g. dumping large partitions), this class is created for this purpose.
 * <p>
 * Note: this class is <b>always buffered internally</b>, do not add another layer of
 * {@link java.io.BufferedInputStream} to add more overhead!
